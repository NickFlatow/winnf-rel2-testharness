# CBSD Testing and Interoperability Repository

This repository contains code and data for testing Citizens Broadband Radio Service Devices (CBSDs) 
and their operation with the Spectrum Access System (SAS).

## Code Prerequisites

* Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

This is the Python runtime which interprets the scripts in the src/ directory.
It may already be running on many platforms, and if it is not already installed, 
is widely available. Type the command `python --version` to check the Python version 
installed on your platform.

* pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

This is the Python package management system. If you have Python installed on your system, 
it may already be available as well. The latest distributions of Python come with `pip` 
pre-bundled so you may not need to retrieve it separately. To check it's availability 
on your system run the command `pip --version`.
